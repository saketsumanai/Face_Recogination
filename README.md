# Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Overview
The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a real-time attendance tracking application using facial recognition. It captures and verifies faces through OpenCV and deep learning, making attendance marking seamless and automated. This project is useful for schools, offices, and events where traditional attendance methods are inefficient.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Automatic attendance marking
- Stores attendance records with timestamps
- User-friendly interface for easy usage
- Supports multiple faces at a time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Face Recognition Library
- Pandas

## 📂 Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saketsumanai/FaceRecognitionAttendanceSystem.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FaceRecognitionAttendanceSystem
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. The system detects and recognizes faces from the camera feed.
2. It matches the detected faces with stored images in the database.
3. If a face is recognized, the system logs attendance with a timestamp.
4. The attendance records are saved in a CSV file for easy access.

## 📌 Usage
- Add new faces to the system by storing their images in the dataset folder.
- Run the script to start real-time face detection and attendance marking.
- Check the generated CSV file for attendance records.


Happy Coding! 😊
